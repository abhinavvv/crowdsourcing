WikiTrust using Semantic Relations
=============

Wikipedia deals with documents which evolve as a sequence of revisions. So, a reputation system based on the quality of work by the user works much better than asking users for feedback. WikiTurst is a content driver reputation system for Wikipedia authors and its content. All the algorithms in WikiTrust are based on word distances over documents. In this project, we built a reputation system based on semantic relations between documents. This preserves the structure and the meaning of the text. Also, this reputation system is compared to the standard word distance method and we report the differences between the two.
